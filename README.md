# Mcblend
A useful tool for creating minecraft content in blender

Mcblend is in the alpha state, so expect bugs and changes during development

This is an experimental branch. I'm testing new features here

> [!NOTE]
> There aren't many functions in Mcblend right now (Below you can see the list of features that are already available and planned)


| Feature | Stage | Current State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade Materials | Done | Upgrade materials function is fully working |
| Procedural PBR | WIP | It works, but I'm still adding new setting and features |
| Fix Materials & Fix World | Done | It works |
| Swap Texture Pack | Not Started | Well, It's not started yet ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Assets | Done | It works, but there is only SRE in built-in assets, also assets needs a better UI |
| Optimization | WIP | There are only two Optimizing options |
