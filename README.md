# Mcblend
Remake of Mcprep

This is an experimental branch. I'm testing new features here

> [!NOTE]
> There aren't many functions in Mcblend right now (Below you can see the list of features that are already available and planned)


| Feature | Stage | Current State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade Materials | Done | Upgrade materials function is fully working, but there is no built-in upgraded materials |
| Fix Materials | Alpha | It works with I think all minecraft blocks |
| Swap Texture Pack | Not Started | Well, It's not started yet ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| interface | Pre-Alpha | There is only three buttons |
| Optimization | Alpha | There are only one Optimizing option |
