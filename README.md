# Mcblend
Remake of Mcprep

This is an experimental branch. I'm testing new features here

> [!NOTE]
> There aren't many functions in Mcblend right now (Below you can see the list of features that are already available and planned)


| Feature | Stage | Current State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade Materials | Done | Upgrade materials function is fully working |
| Procedural PBR | WIP | It works, but I'm still polishing Data.py |
| Fix Materials & Fix World | Done | It works ig |
| Swap Texture Pack | Not Started | Well, It's not started yet ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Assets | Done | It works, but there is only SRE in built-in assets |
| Optimization | WIP | There are only two Optimizing option |
