# Mcblend
Remake of Mcprep

This brach contains almost realtime changes, so use it only if you want to test new features or help me with finding bugs

> [!WARNING]
> This addon is in pre-alpha, so expect a lot of bugs.
> 
 
> [!NOTE]
> Differences between Mcprep and Mcblend:
> 1. Much less features, since It's in pre-alpha


| Feature | Stage | Current State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade Materials | Pre-alpha | Materials can be appended, but there is no buit-in upgraded materials |
| Fix Materials | Alpha | It works with I think all minecraft blocks |
| Swap Texture Pack | Not Started | Well, It's not started yet ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| interface | Pre-alpha | There is only one button and it works properly |
| Optimization | Alpha | Only camera culling for now |
